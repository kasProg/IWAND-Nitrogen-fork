'''
Users can expand IWAND-Nitrogen by extracting additional forcings or applying the workflow to new watersheds. The function below demonstrates how to:
1. Read a watershed shapefile.
2. Reproject to the correct coordinate system as needed.
3. Compute zonal statistics (e.g., mean) of any raster forcing dataset.
4. Export a dataframe with watershed attributes and basin-averaged forcing values.
